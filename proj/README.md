## To run Dyna-Q and Prioritized Sweeping
1. Navigate to the folder (in the format algorithm>/domain)
2. For example, navigate to Dyna-Q/687-gridworld
3. Run dynaq.py
4. To test the algorithm run test_dynaq.py
5. We follow similar steps for Prioritized Sweeping. 
6. The MountainCar and CartPole environments work in OpenAi gym rendering mode as well. 
7. To use them, run the training code, and load the saved pickle file of the agent into the testing code.
